<p class="text-main"><span class="t">T</span>he desire to be respected by someone of the opposite</br> sex is something that runs deep within everyone, even</br> though most people don't take the time to find someone</br> who truly respect them.It seems like people are just</br> loooking for someone to show them the slightest amount of attention, settling for something much less than respect. I am convinced one of the best way to help a relationship </br>grow is by showing respect.</br>
  </br>
I have come to the conclusion that everyone longs to be respected. What is respect? respect is showing someone extra special attention, or high regard, based on a desire to show them how highly they are valued.</p>
